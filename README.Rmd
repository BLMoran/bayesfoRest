## Overview

bayesfoRest is an R package for creating publication-ready forest plots from Bayesian meta-analyses. It provides a comprehensive solution for visualizing meta-analytic results with support for various effect measures, subgroup analyses, and risk of bias assessments.

## Key Features

- **Bayesian Forest Plots**: Create forest plots from brms models with customizable aesthetics
- **Multiple Effect Measures**: Support for OR, HR, RR, IRR, MD, and SMD
- **Subgroup Analysis**: Built-in support for subgroup meta-analyses
- **Risk of Bias Integration**: Seamlessly incorporate risk of bias assessments (RoB2, ROBINS-I, ROBINS-E, QUADAS-2)
- **Shrinkage Visualisation**: Display shrinkage effects with density plots or point intervals
- **ROPE Support**: Add Region of Practical Equivalence (ROPE) to plots
- **Extensive Customisation**: Colours, fonts, labels, and layout

## Installation

You can install the development version of bayesfoRest from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("BLMoran/bayesfoRest")
```

## Basic Usage

### Binary Outcome Forest Plot (Odds Ratio)
```{r example, eval=FALSE}
bayes_forest(
  model = model_bin,
  data = binary_outcome,
  measure = "OR",
  xlim = c(0.1, 3.5)
)
```
![](man/figures/forest_plot_binary.png)


### Add Subgroups

```r
bayes_forest(
  model = model_bin,
  data = binary_outcome,
  measure = "OR",
  subgroup = T,
  xlim = c(0.1, 3.5)
)
```
![](man/figures/forest_plot_subgroup.png)





### Add Risk of Bias Columns

```r
bayes_forest(
  model = model_bin,
  data = binary_outcome,
  measure = "OR",
  subgroup = T,
  add_rob = T,
  xlim = c(0.1, 3.5)
)
```

### Add Risk of Bias Legend
```r
bayes_forest(
  model = model_bin,
  data = binary_outcome,
  measure = "OR",
  subgroup = T,
  add_rob = T,
  add_rob_legend = T,
  rob_tool = "rob2",
  xlim = c(0.1, 3.5)
)
```
![](man/figures/forest_plot_rob_legend.png)

### Exclude Studies with High Risk of Bias
```r
bayes_forest(
  model = model_bin,
  data = binary_outcome,
  measure = "OR",
  subgroup = T,
  add_rob = T,
  add_rob_legend = T,
  rob_tool = "rob2",
  exclude_high_rob = T,
  xlim = c(0.1, 3.5)
)
```
![](man/figures/forest_excl_high_rob.png)

### Standalone Risk of Bias Plot

```r
# Create standalone RoB visualization
rob_plot(
  data = binary_outcome,
  rob_tool = "rob2",
  add_rob_legend = TRUE
)
```
