\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted brmsfit object from a Bayesian meta-analysis}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the study data used to fit the model}

\item{priors}{A named list of brms prior specifications (created with \code{brms::prior()})
with names typically including "vague", "weakreg", and "informative"}

\item{measure}{Character string specifying the effect measure.   One of "OR" (odds ratio),
"RR" (risk ratio), "HR" (hazard ratio), "IRR" (incidence rate ratio),
"MD" (mean difference), or "SMD" (standardized mean difference)}

\item{study_var}{Optional.   Name of the study identifier variable (unquoted). Required
if \code{incl_pet_peese = TRUE} or \code{incl_mixture = TRUE}}

\item{rob_var}{Optional.  Name of the risk of bias variable (unquoted). Should contain
values like "Low", "Some concerns", "High"}

\item{exclude_high_rob}{Logical. If TRUE, performs sensitivity analysis excluding
studies with high risk of bias.   Default is FALSE}

\item{incl_pet_peese}{Logical. If TRUE, includes PET-PEESE bias adjustment analysis.
Default is FALSE}

\item{pet_peese_direction}{Character string.  Direction of expected bias for PET-PEESE.
Either "negative" or "positive".   Default is "negative"}

\item{pet_peese_threshold}{Numeric. Threshold for choosing between PET and PEESE
(based on proportion of studies showing effect). Default is 0.10}

\item{incl_mixture}{Logical. If TRUE, includes robust mixture model analysis.
Default is FALSE}

\item{incl_bma}{Logical. If TRUE, includes Bayesian model averaging results.
Default is FALSE}

\item{model_bma}{Named list of RoBMA model fits (from \code{RoBMA_brms()}) to include
in model averaging.  Names should be "vague", "weakreg", or "informative"}

\item{prob_reference}{Character string. What reference to use for probability calculations.
Either "null" (compare to null_value) or "null_range" (compare to null_range boundaries).
Default is "null"}

\item{null_value}{Numeric. The null value for the effect measure.  If NULL, uses
default based on measure (1 for ratio measures, 0 for difference measures)}

\item{null_range}{Numeric vector of length 2 or single numeric value.   Defines the
range of practical equivalence around the null value.}

\item{add_null_range}{Logical. If TRUE, displays the null range region on the plot.
Default is FALSE}

\item{color_null_range}{Character string. Color for the null range region.
Default is "#77bb41" (green)}

\item{label_control}{Character string. Label for the control/reference group.
Default is "Control"}

\item{label_intervention}{Character string. Label for the intervention group.
Default is "Intervention"}

\item{title}{Optional character string. Main title for the plot}

\item{subtitle}{Optional character string. Subtitle for the plot}

\item{xlim}{Optional numeric vector of length 2.   X-axis limits for the plot}

\item{x_breaks}{Optional numeric vector.   Custom x-axis break points}

\item{color_palette}{Optional named character vector of colors for each section.
Names should match section labels (e.g., "All studies", "Excluding High RoB", etc.)}

\item{show_density}{Logical. If TRUE, includes a density plot below the ECDF.
Default is TRUE}

\item{prior_to_plot}{Character string.  Which prior specification to plot in the ECDF.
One of "vague", "weakreg", or "informative".  Default is "weakreg"}

\item{font}{Optional character string. Font family to use for the plot}
}
\value{
A ggplot object (or patchwork object if \code{show_density = TRUE})
}
\description{
Creates an empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) plot showing
posterior distributions across different sensitivity analyses (All studies,
Excluding High RoB, PET-PEESE, Mixture Model, BMA).
}
\details{
This function creates an ECDF plot that displays the cumulative probability
distributions of pooled effects across different sensitivity analyses.  The plot
includes:
\itemize{
\item Left y-axis: Probability that mean effect < x
\item Right y-axis: Probability that mean effect > x
\item Optional density curves below the ECDF
\item Optional region of practical equivalence (ROPE) shading
}

The \code{prob_reference} argument controls how probabilities are calculated:
\itemize{
\item "null":   Probabilities are calculated relative to the null value (e.g., OR = 1)
\item "null_range":   Probabilities are calculated relative to the null range boundaries
(left y-axis shows P(effect < lower bound), right y-axis shows P(effect > upper bound))
}
